# Challenge 1

## Description

This is the first challenge for Module 1. This is my third time trying to get this right.

This site contains a header, some images, and sections of the main content, and a benefits information section.
Any changes made were just fixing some formatting. For example, unnecessary spacing or adding alt text to the images and
also adding a missing id to the search-optimization.

This assignment is to make the html code more readable, by replacing divs with semantic elements. Now we can clearly see
where the header, nav, and section elements are placed.
